## The internet is free - 
if you know where to look. And this applies to learning software development, too.

There are tons of resources which are FOR FREE, but they happen to miss out the SEO wagon race and are usually outta the public's eye. The result? Many of us do end up shelling out
precious bucks for courses, which you might've got for free.

Not to say paid content isn't good - it's great. It saves time, you get some extra tidbits and you get a much better service. But paying for content shouldn't be a compulsion, because
there are always gonna be free alternatives.

That's the reason with which I am starting this repository. It'll include FREE content, from places that you might not have known exist - Blogs, YouTube channels, documentation that is actually fun to read, and more. The focus will be on lesser known resources more - almost everyone knows sources like [GeeksforGeeks](https://geeksforgeeks.org), but not many know of resources like [Educative](https://www.educative.io/unlimited?aff=xk40) or [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com)

I'd love to have new contributions - the terms : it should be free/have a free section ALONGSIDE a paid section, it should NOT be pirated(aka, hacked, torrent versions of courses that were originally paid are a no, here) - create PRs with the name and link to the resource with a brief description. Here is a [Reference](https://github.com/dkp1903/freesources/blob/main/Courses.md)
