GitHub Student Developer Pack is an excellent resource for a ton of learning material, free access to developer tools, hosting solutions, all at 0 cost, the only prerequisite being that you have to
be a student. Here is how you can sign up for the pack : 

1. Head to the [Student Pack Website](https://education.github.com/pack)

2. You'll see an option to apply for the pack. Click it.

3. You'll be asked to fill a short form, asking you to add your email(preferably an institute email, though these days, they even accept gmail/yahoo ones), upload a scanned copy
of your student ID(institute ID), and a question of how you aim to use the pack.

4. You'll receive a confirmation mail from them around 6-10 days after you fill the form. You can then head over to [the Student Pack Website](https://education.github.com/pack)
and follow the individual instructions for any resource that you might want to wish to access.
